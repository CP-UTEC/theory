## Competitive Programming UTEC 

On this repository you will find the materials developed for UTECs competitive programming beginners training. This is oriented towards first year students that are relatively new to programming. We look to induce them in the world of competitive programming by introducing them to algorithms, problem solving paradigms and how coding competitions work.
